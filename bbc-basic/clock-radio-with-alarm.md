Although I use the wake-up function regularly and as far as I know it functions well, I accept no liability whatsoever in the event that you oversleep and therefore arrive late for work/appointment or miss your plane. So use at your own risk ;-)

USAGE
=====

The buttons and LEDs have been given a new function. The buttons, from left to right, have the following meaning:

_1st key: A for Alarm_
This button switches on the alarm. The set alarm time appears on the display for 15 seconds. The red LED turns on, indicating that the alarm is active. When the alarm time is reached, the radio turns on. By pressing the A button you switch off the radio for ten minutes (snooze). Pressing the R button turns the radio off. However, the alarm remains active for the next day. If the alarm is active, you can turn it off by pressing the A button again.

_2nd key: R for Radio_
This button switches the radio on or off. When switched on, the set frequency appears on the display for 15 seconds. If you press and hold the R button for three seconds when switching on, you will switch on the sleep timer function. You can choose from 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes. Enabling the sleep timer disables the snooze function.

_3rd key: M for Mode_
This is the button to set the settings of the clock radio. When pressed repeatedly, this button shows the function to be set. These are successively:
Temperature: shows the temperature (this cannot be changed). The temperature is measured with the CPU's internal sensor. In fact, the temperature of the processor is displayed and not the ambient temperature. Since this clock does not require much from the processor, the processor temperature will reasonably correspond to the ambient temperature. To prevent excessively variable displays of the temperature, it is measured a maximum of once per minute.
Time: the letter 't' will appear on the display, then press the H- and/or M+ key to set the time.
Alarm: the letter 'A' appears on the display, then press the H- and/or M+ key to set the time.
Loudness: the display will show the letter 'L', then press the H- button to increase the volume or the M+ button to decrease the volume. The volume can be adjusted in a range of 0 – 15.
Brightness: the letter 'b' will appear on the display, then press the H- key to increase the brightness of the display or the M+ key to decrease the brightness. The brightness can be adjusted in a range of 0 – 7. In position 'A' the brightness is automatically set to day and night.
Frequency: the display will show the letter 'F', then press the H- button to search for a radio station on a lower frequency or the M+ button to search for a station on a higher frequency. The frequency range is from 87 – 108 MHz. The last frequency set is saved.
Carousel: the display shows the time, radio frequency and temperature in succession for 20 seconds.
If the radio is not switched on when using the Mode button, the settings for Loudness and Frequency will not be displayed. The frequency will also not be displayed in the carousel.

_4th Key: H-_
This key increases the hours when setting the time or alarm time. With the other settings, this button reduces the set value.

_5th Key: M+_
This button increases the minutes when setting the time or alarm time. For the other settings, this button increases the set value.

If no key is pressed for 15 seconds, the time will be displayed again, unless the carousel function has been selected.
